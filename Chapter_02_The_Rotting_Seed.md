## Chapter 2: The Rotting Seed

The silence that descended after Rohan’s final, rattling breath was not an absence of sound, but a palpable presence. It pressed in on Arjun, thick and cloying, saturated with the sickly-sweet perfume of decay and the metallic tang of fresh blood. His own breathing was ragged, shallow, each inhale a searing agony in his chest, each exhale a desperate attempt to expel the horror that had just unfolded. The dim light filtering through the blinds, now a bruised, inky black, did little to illuminate the scene, yet Arjun’s eyes were seared with the image: the dark, writhing knot of roots on Rohan's bunk, still faintly pulsing with that unnatural luminescence, a testament to the *prana-vinimaya* fulfilled. It was a seed of death, violently sown into the very fabric of their shared existence.

He could still feel the phantom touch of those roots, the memory of their dry, rasping scrape against the windowpane, the insidious way they had felt for purchase. They were an extension, he now understood with chilling clarity, not just of the banyan’s spirit, but of its hunger. It had not needed to break the glass; its tendrils were already within, seeking the weakest vessel, the closest source of vitality. Rohan, sleeping soundly, oblivious to the curse Arjun had foolishly invoked, had been the easiest target. Guilt, a hot, corrosive tide, churned in Arjun's gut, eclipsing fear for a fleeting, agonizing moment. He had not just summoned the Pishach; he had delivered Rohan to it.

Arjun’s limbs, previously leaden, thrummed with frantic energy. He had to get out. He had to get away. But where? The chanting, the *prana-vinimaya*, the horrific birth of the root-mass from Rohan’s chest – it all felt like a fever dream, a hallucination born of exhaustion and Trichy’s oppressive humidity. Yet, the undeniable stench of death, clinging to the air like a shroud, was brutally real. He stumbled towards the door, hands slick with sweat. He had to tell someone. But who would believe him? A faceless tree demon? A cursed mantra? A life exchanged for a life? They’d think him mad, a product of too much caffeine and too little sleep. The low hum of the hostel generator, the distant murmur of a late-night movie, the mundane symphony of student life continued, indifferent to the tragedy.

He wrenched the door open, stepping into the dimly lit corridor. The air outside his room was marginally cooler, but the scent of rot followed him, a phantom trail. Flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows, transforming familiar posters and notice boards into grotesque shapes. He felt it—a subtle pressure against his skin, a creeping cold that had nothing to do with the ambient temperature. The Pishach’s lingering presence, a stain on the edges of reality. He imagined the roots, not confined to Rohan’s bunk, but spreading, seeping through the concrete, weaving their silent, predatory network beneath the building. Was it still here? Lurking? Waiting?

He found himself drawn, as if by an invisible tether, towards the library. The hushed sanctity of the stacks, usually a refuge, now felt ominous. Towering shelves, crammed with knowledge, seemed to lean inwards, the air thick with the scent of aging paper and dust. He ran his hand along a spine, the rough texture a tangible sensation. He needed answers, anything to explain this madness, to understand the mechanism of this curse. He remembered his grandfather’s distant cousin, a man steeped in the lore of their ancestral village in Odisha, a man Arjun had dismissed as a relic. He had spoken of the Vriksha-Pishach not as a singular entity, but as an ancient force, tied to specific places, to the very earth itself. His grandfather had always warned him about straying too far from their roots, both literal and metaphorical. Perhaps now was the time to heed those words, to seek the root of this darkness.

He found a section on obscure folklore and mythology, fingers trembling as he scanned the titles. Nothing. Just academic dissections of superstitions, devoid of the visceral terror he had just experienced. He pulled out a dusty volume, its cover depicting a stylized tree with unsettlingly human-like branches. The title: “Rooted Terrors: Unearthing the Forest Spirits of Eastern India.” His heart pounded. He flipped through the brittle pages, eyes scanning for keywords: banyan, curse, transference, mantra. Then he saw it. A passage, barely a paragraph, discussing a forgotten cult in the coastal regions of Odisha, near the Chilika Lake. They worshipped a primal entity, the *Aranya-Rakshak*, the Guardian of the Forest, appeased with blood sacrifices for good harvests and protection. The text hinted at a method of appeasement involving a specific incantation, spoken at twilight, and a gruesome ritual of *prana-vinimaya*, a life exchange. The guardian, it stated, could manifest through the roots of ancient trees, extending its influence through shadows and reflections. If no willing sacrifice was offered, it would claim one itself, drawing sustenance from the living until the summoner and their kin were withered husks.

Arjun’s blood ran cold. The description was uncannily similar, yet subtly different. *Aranya-Rakshak* instead of Vriksha-Pishach. But the core elements – the twilight invocation, the life exchange, the arboreal manifestation, the parasitic hunger – were identical. The text mentioned the Rakshak’s power was strongest when tied to a specific, ancient banyan, a ‘Mother Tree,’ and its influence could seep into the very foundation of structures built on its encroaching root system. NIT Trichy. The sprawling campus, the ancient banyan at its heart, the very ground they walked on… it was all connected. But why here? What was the historical link between this engineering hub and a remote Odiya village?

He traced faint lines on a crudely drawn map in the book. Villages, marked by vague symbols, lay near a large, ancient banyan grove. The text noted a period of severe drought and famine centuries ago, when the Rakshak became particularly ravenous. Local legends spoke of a desperate ritual, performed by villagers seeking to appease the entity, that had gone terribly wrong, unleashing a dark power that still lingered. The cult had faded, its rituals relegated to whispers, but the Mother Tree, and the entity it housed, remained.

A sudden, sharp pain lanced through Arjun’s hand. He looked down, breath catching in his throat. His fingers, the ones he’d used to grip the book, were darkening, a purplish hue spreading from the tips. Beneath the skin, familiar veins became prominent, twisting like tiny, black roots. He felt a faint, unnerving thrumming from within his own flesh. The *prana-vinimaya*, not just enacted, but actively taking root. The curse was not just a debt; it was a slow, insidious invasion. Life force leached from his own body.

He remembered Rohan’s transformation, the unnatural darkness spreading through his limbs, the agonizing emergence of the root-mass. The same was happening to him, only slower, more subtly. The Pishach was consuming him from within, a patient predator, preparing him for assimilation. A strange, detached curiosity surfaced, a morbid fascination with the physical decay. The book’s words echoed: “If no willing sacrifice is offered, it will claim one itself, drawing sustenance from the living until the summoner and their kin are withered husks.” He had lost Rohan. Now, he was becoming the next withered husk.

Panic warred with a desperate need for understanding. Could he find help here, on campus? Or was this evil too ancient, too deeply rooted? His grandfather’s voice, a familiar whisper of caution from his childhood in Odisha, echoed in his mind: *"Stray too far from your roots, Arjun, and the darkness will find you."* The words, once dismissed as rustic superstition, now resonated with chilling truth. The *Aranya-Rakshak*, tied to a Mother Tree, its influence seeping into the very foundations of NIT Trichy… it was a connection forged by history, a dark inheritance. The instinctual pull towards his ancestral home, towards the knowledge held by his grandfather, a custodian of fading traditions, became undeniable. He needed to go back. Back to the source.

He slammed the book shut, the sound unnervingly loud in the stillness. He had to get help. Not from the authorities, but from someone who understood. He thought of his grandfather, the keeper of their family's traditions. He needed to go home. To the village. To the heart of the darkness.

As he turned to leave the library, a shadow fell across the aisle. Too long, too angular, to be cast by shelves or light fixtures. Arjun froze, heart leaping into his throat. He dared not look up, but he felt it—a palpable sense of ancient, arboreal dread. The air grew heavy, carrying the familiar scent of damp earth and something else… floral, yet cloyingly sweet, like lilies beginning to rot. The scent of the Pishach, stronger now, closer than ever. A faint tremor ran under his feet, a deep, resonating thrum from the building's very foundations. The silence seemed to stretch, to thicken, amplifying the frantic thudding of his own heart. Each flicker of the fluorescent lights seemed to cast the shadows deeper, making the familiar rows of books appear like rows of waiting, skeletal figures.

Slowly, agonizingly, he raised his eyes. Hanging in the air, suspended between the bookshelves, was a reflection. Not of the library, or himself, but a distorted, swirling image of a dense, impossibly ancient banyan grove, its roots thick as python coils, its branches reaching into a perpetually twilight sky. Within that reflected grove, a form stirred. Faceless, its limbs like gnarled, root-like appendages, contorting and stretching. It was not the entity from his window, but its true form, its primal essence. As he watched, mesmerized by terror, a single, impossibly long root, slick with dark, viscous sap, snaked out of the reflection, moving with deliberate, unnerving speed. Not towards him, but towards the worn leather satchel at his feet, the one containing his laptop, his notes, his research. It was reaching for his connection to the outside world, the seed of his knowledge, ready to consume it. The creeping darkness on his own fingers pulsed in time with the root’s inexorable advance.
