## Chapter 1: The Whisper of the Banyan

The air in Arjun’s dorm room, normally thick with the stale scent of instant noodles and restless ambition, felt unusually heavy tonight. It was the humid breath of Trichy, yes, the kind that clung to the skin like a second, clammy shirt, but tonight it carried an undercurrent, a subtle dissonance that prickled at the back of his neck. Sunlight, a searing orange that bled through the gaps in the drawn blinds, was beginning its reluctant retreat, painting long, distorted shadows across the linoleum floor. The low hum of the ceiling fan, a constant companion in the stifling heat, seemed to waver, its rhythm faltering like a faltering heartbeat. Arjun, hunched over his thermodynamics textbook, found his gaze drifting, snagged by the play of light and shadow on the peeling paint of the opposite wall. It was there, in the amorphous shapes, that he began to see them: impossibly long, spindly limbs reaching, twisting, as if straining against an unseen restraint.

He blinked, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand, the rough texture of his skin a grounding sensation. Just fatigue. The relentless pressure of impending exams, the gnawing anxiety of a future precariously balanced on a string of formulae and lab reports. Yet, the image lingered, superimposed on the mundane reality of his shared room. The faint scent of something earthy, damp, and vaguely decaying, like turned soil after a monsoon rain, seemed to bloom in the stale air, overriding the usual olfactory landscape of student living. He tried to focus on the equations, the elegant dance of variables and constants, but his mind kept snagging on the whispered fragments of an old village tale, a story he’d dismissed as superstition, the ramblings of a drunkard elder during his last visit to his ancestral village in Odisha. A story about… trees. And something that dwelled within them.

A sharp rap on the door jolted him. "Arjun! You alive in there? Sun’s almost gone, and I swear I heard a bloody owl in the banyan outside our window again. Freaks me out, man." It was Rohan, his roommate, his voice laced with a nervous tremor that belied his usual boisterous facade. Arjun forced a smile, though his lips felt stiff, disconnected. "Just wrestling with enthalpy, Ro. Be right there." He gathered his books, his movements stiff, as if his limbs were reluctant to obey. As he stood, he caught sight of his reflection in the darkened window pane. For a fleeting instant, the face looking back wasn’t entirely his own. The shadows seemed to deepen around his eyes, making them hollow voids, and his mouth stretched into a grimace that felt alien. Then it was gone, replaced by his own anxious features.

Outside, the twilight deepened, the sky bleeding into bruised purples and fiery oranges. The usual cacophony of the campus – the distant roar of a motorcycle, the boisterous laughter from a nearby common room, the chirping of unseen insects – seemed to recede, replaced by a more profound silence, a listening quiet. The enormous banyan tree that dominated the quadrangle, its aerial roots dangling like arthritic fingers, cast an immense, inky shadow that seemed to swallow the last vestiges of light. Rohan shivered, pulling his tattered sweater tighter. "Seriously, Arjun, it’s like this place gets… heavy… when dusk falls. Especially near that tree. Always has."

Arjun nodded, his gaze fixed on the gnarled mass of the banyan. A faint, almost imperceptible rustling emanated from its depths, a sound that wasn’t quite the wind. It was deeper, more deliberate, like the creak of ancient wood under immense strain. A whisper, he thought, or perhaps the sigh of something waking. He remembered the elder’s words, spoken in a voice raspy with age and fear: *"The Vriksha-Pishach… it wakes at the sun’s last breath. It demands its due. A life for a life, *prana-vinimaya*… or it takes what it desires."* He had laughed then, dismissed it as folklore. Now, a cold dread, sharp and metallic, began to coil in his stomach. He understood the *prana-vinimaya* not as a simple exchange, but as a parasitic transference of life force, a draining of vitality until only a husk remained, which the Pishach would then inhabit.

Later that night, sleep offered no respite. Arjun tossed and turned, the oppressive heat doing little to soothe his frayed nerves. Dreams, vivid and unsettling, plagued him. He dreamt of roots, thick and sinewy, burrowing into his flesh, dragging him down into the damp earth. He dreamt of a towering, faceless entity, its form a contortion of bark and twisted branches, its silent gaze fixed upon him. He woke with a gasp, his body slick with sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs. The room was plunged in darkness, save for the faint, phosphorescent glow of his digital alarm clock: 5:58 PM. The air grew colder, the faint, sweetish scent of rotting jasmine and damp earth intensifying, thick and cloying. It was the smell of the Pishach, the Elder had said. The scent that heralded its presence, that weakened the veil between worlds.

Then, a sound. A soft, rhythmic scraping, emanating from outside his window. *Scrape. Scrape. Scrape.* It was the sound of rough bark against rough wood, a dry, rasping whisper that seemed to slither into the room. Arjun’s breath hitched. He slowly turned his head, his muscles protesting, his eyes straining to pierce the gloom. The window pane was a dark mirror, reflecting his own terrified face, but beyond it, against the fading twilight sky, something was moving. It was impossibly tall, its silhouette obscuring the already dim light, a gaunt, arboreal horror. Limbs, like the gnarled, descending roots of the banyan, stretched and writhed, impossibly long, impossibly thin. It wasn’t an animal. It wasn’t human. It was the shape from his dreams, the Vriksha-Pishach, a spirit of decay and parasitic hunger, bound to ancient trees.

Rohan stirred beside him, mumbling in his sleep. Arjun felt a primal urge to scream, to wrench himself from the bed and flee, but his limbs were leaden, his throat tight, constricted by the encroaching scent. The scraping continued, louder now, closer. He could hear a low, guttural sound, like the grinding of stones, accompanied by a faint, almost musical hum, the same tune the elder had hummed, the same tune that now echoed in Arjun’s mind, a chilling, ancient mantra. It was a language of the earth, a call to the slumbering spirit.

*“Vriksha-pishacham… avahayami… shakti-pradanam… prana-vinimayam…”*

The words, unbidden, rose in his throat, a dry, desperate whisper. He had recited them, foolishly, a week ago, trying to impress a girl from the folklore club with his “knowledge” of rural superstitions. A dare. A drunken boast. He hadn’t meant to *say* them, not properly, not with intent. But the Vriksha-Pishach fed on spoken intent, on the resonance of ancient words. As the entity outside his window seemed to swell, its form solidifying against the dying light, he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he had sealed his fate. The mantra had been spoken with enough conviction. The summoning had begun. The curse was not just on him, but on whoever shared his space, a twisted form of transference until a suitable sacrifice was found.

The scraping stopped. A profound silence descended, broken only by the frantic thumping of Arjun’s own heart. Then, a single, sharp crack echoed through the night, like a bone snapping. The windowpane shuddered. A long, dark finger, like a root tipped with earth, slid into view, feeling its way along the frame. Arjun choked back a sob. He was trapped. The *prana-vinimaya*. The curse. The Elder’s warning, laced with the scent of decay, slammed into him with the force of a physical blow. He had twenty-four hours. Twenty-four hours to find a life to exchange for his own, or for Rohan’s. And the Vriksha-Pishach, the Tree Demon, had just made its presence undeniably known.

Suddenly, Rohan cried out, a strangled yelp from his bunk. Arjun’s head snapped around. Rohan was sitting bolt upright, his eyes wide with terror, staring not at Arjun, nor at the window, but at his own hands. His fingers were darkening, veins bulging like black worms beneath the skin, spreading with unnatural speed. A low moan escaped his lips, a sound of unbearable pain. Arjun watched, paralyzed, as the life force within Rohan began to drain, a faint, phosphorescent green light emanating from his chest, growing brighter, more intense, like a trapped firefly struggling to break free. It pulsed, in rhythm with the faint hum that still resonated in the air. The scent of decay intensified, tinged now with the sharp, coppery tang of blood. Rohan’s body began to convulse, his moans escalating into a guttural shriek. The light within him surged, and then, with a sickening wet tearing sound, a small, impossibly dense knot of gnarled roots erupted from his chest, pulsing with a faint, sickly luminescence. Rohan’s eyes rolled back, his body went limp, and he slumped back onto his bunk, silent. The roots, still writhing, fell to the floor with a soft thud, already drawing sustenance from the cooling flesh. The scraping at the window had stopped. The entity was gone, sated for now. But the cost had already begun to be paid. Arjun was left alone in the suffocating silence, the chilling realization dawning that he was not just a target, but a harbinger of death for those closest to him. The curse had taken its first, horrifying toll.
